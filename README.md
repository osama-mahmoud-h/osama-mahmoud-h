🔰 what i can do for you :

1️⃣ Build robust and scalable backend applications using Java Spring Boot and Node.js Express framework. Experience with both technologies allows flexibility to choose the most suitable option based on your project requirements.

2️⃣ Implement database schemas and optimize queries using SQL and NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB and Elasticsearch. This ensures data is securely stored and efficiently retrieved.

3️⃣ Develop real-time features using technologies like Kafka and Redis to enable instant updates and push notifications. This improves user experience and engagement.

4️⃣ Leverage microservice architecture to split applications into independently deployable services. This improves scalability, fault tolerance and maintenance.

5️⃣ Integrate frontend frameworks like React.js to build full-stack applications with optimized performance.

6️⃣ Implement best software development practices like OOP, SOLID principles and design patterns to develop robust and extendable applications.

7️⃣ Proven problem-solving skills through competitive programming experience and ability to solve complex technical challenges.

8️⃣ Hands-on experience building web applications in different domains like social networks, blogs, search engines and chat applications.
